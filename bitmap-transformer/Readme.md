## Bitmap part 1

The Bitmap library supports transforms of bitmap image files.

It is a command line program. It takes 3 arguments:
1. The path and file of an image to transform.
2. The path and file name to write transformed image.
3. The type of transform to perform.

Example:
```resources/Randomize_Test.bmp resources/Randomize_Output.bmp randomize```

The following transforms are supported:
1. black_and_white
2. flip_horizontal
3. flip_vertical
4. randomize
